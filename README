The following is instructions for running our scripts:

Tweet gathering:
    In the tweet_gathering folder, the script gatherTweets.py shows
    how we used the Twitter API with tweepy to gather our Twitter data.
    This script cannot be run, as we are not providing our API creds,
    but it is short and can be examined to see how we went about doing so.
    The csv files in the root folder are the result of this script.

Deep Learning Models:
    In the deep_learning folder are our attempts at deep learning summarization.

    charSummarizer.py can be run, but it will take 6 hours on a macbook pro and
    the results are not worth it. The results can be seen in the report, and the
    model it produces is 1000_data_char_model.h5.

    wordSummarizer.py is our attempt at changing the s2s model from character level
    to word level, which is much more common in the area of text summarization.
    This can be run, but has an error in the fit call that we were not able to figure
    out.

    translator.py is the english-french translator that does work, was taken from
    the keras blog mentioned in the report, and can be run in a very quick amount
    of time for good results. It is included as a demonstration that the encoder-decoder
    model is set up correctly, yet does not work for the task of summarization.
    The resources we found on summarization using basic encoder-decoder use basically
    the same code, so we were unable to figure out why it didn't work for us.
